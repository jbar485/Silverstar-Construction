            We are  finally all settled in. A big thanks to you, your boys and Donny. The craftmanship and care you put into our home really shows. Without the "Barton-boys" this build would have become a disaster. We both are so grateful and humbled by the way you conduct buisness, how you guided us through every step and really supported us in the last final push. You were the key component in making our build turn out well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you...
